### Project Title
**Credit Card Fraud Detection using Logistic Regression**

### Description
Logistic Regression is a regression approach used for predicting only two possible values.

For this project, we will be building a machine learning model to classify whether a credit card transaction is *Legit* or *Fraudulent* based on numerical input variables which are the result of a PCA transformation included in the dataset. Our goal is to work through this notebook by collecting data, preprocessing it, splitting it into testing and training datasets, train the model and evaluate the accuracy of our model.

### Files used
We used the following dataset available on Kaggle to work on this project:

* [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

The datasets consists of several features which are transformed using PCA due to confidentiality issues and one target variable.

### Credits
Thanks to Kaggle for teaching me ML :sparkles: :heart: :sparkles:
